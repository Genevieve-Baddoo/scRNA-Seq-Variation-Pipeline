Overview

Dr. Barefield’s Lab (Barefield Lab) is interested in the heterogeneity of cells within the CCS. The Cardiac Conduction System (CCS) is a group of specialized muscle cells found in the heart’s walls. These muscle cells send signals to the rest of the heart muscle, which causes a contraction. Their distinct components include the sinoatrial node (SAN), the atrioventricular node/His bundle(AVN/His), and Purkinje fiber (PF) regions. The cells within these components were typically thought to be “homogeneous”. But each component of the CCS consists of unique cardiac cell types with their own physiological properties. Therefore, these components have significant cellular heterogeneity. The analysis of individual single cells within the CCS is important to discover the mechanisms of the heart not seen by studying a bulk population of cardiac cells.
