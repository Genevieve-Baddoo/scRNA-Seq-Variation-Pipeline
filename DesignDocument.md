Overview

Dr. Barefield’s Lab (Barefield Lab) is interested in the heterogeneity of cells within the CCS. The Cardiac Conduction System (CCS) is a group of specialized muscle cells found in the heart’s walls. These muscle cells send signals to the rest of the heart muscle, which causes a contraction. Their distinct components include the sinoatrial node (SAN), the atrioventricular node/His bundle(AVN/His), and Purkinje fiber (PF) regions. The cells within these components were typically thought to be “homogeneous”. But each component of the CCS consists of unique cardiac cell types with their own physiological properties. Therefore, these components have significant cellular heterogeneity. The analysis of individual single cells within the CCS is important to discover the mechanisms of the heart not seen by studying a bulk population of cardiac cells.

Presently, there are a limited number of distinct molecular markers for the different CCS cell types. Knowing this creates challenges for additional investigation into their speciation, patterning, and function. Prior studies have assessed gene expression with individual components of the CCS, but they are unable to discern cell-type heterogeneity due to bulk tissue analysis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can discern cell-type heterogeneity because it allows for global gene expression analysis at single-cell resolution. This type of sequencing identifies expression differences between individual cells in tissues previously thought to be homogenous in the CCS. The scRNA-Seq-Variation-Pipeline built here will re-map, cluster, and quantify scRNA-seq data from Goodyer et al. This paper discusses the transcriptomic profiling of the developing CCS at single-cell resolution in wild-type mouse hearts. Creating this pipeline using bioinformatics analysis will identify genes in the CCS with high expression variance within clusters.
